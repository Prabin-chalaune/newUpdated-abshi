          Finding the right place to stay overseas after you‚Äôve enrolled at a university can entail several options,
          while also making it difficult to decide. In general, there are three types of study abroad accommodation
          choices, namely: university residence, homestay, and apartment living. If you choose to stay at the university
          residence, then get ready for a myriad of new experiences. You‚Äôll meet foreign students from different parts of
          the world, interact with almost everyone and develop long-lasting friendships.

          A homestay is another option that an international student can consider. A homestay is arranged for
          international students (usually below 18 years) to live with a local host or relative during their study period
          abroad. You will most probably get your own room while enjoying the family company and being a part of the daily
          routine and meals together. Alternatively, a homestay could also mean living with a host family unknown or
          unrelated to the student. This family has children of their own but would love to meet international students
          and get exposed to different cultures.
